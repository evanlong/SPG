## Welcome

The purpose of Simple Page Gen (SPG) is to make it easy to build a simple
multipage website with a few markdown files.

## Install

`pip intall spg`

## Getting started

Once SPG is installed the easiest way to get started is by running `spg create
your_new_site_name`. This will create a new folder in the current directory
named `your_new_site_name` with a template which happens to be this
documentation site.
